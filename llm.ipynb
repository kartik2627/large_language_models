Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head\\nattention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every\\ndetail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and\\ntensor2tensor.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens.

We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via RLHF). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.\\nA large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.\\nThere is also a branch of work on attacking LLMs to extract pre-training data, private knowledge (Carlini et al, 2020) or attacking model training process via data poisoning (Carlini et al. 2023). We would not cover those topics in this post.\\nBasics#\\nThreat Model#\\nAdversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired. Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.\\n\\nFig. 1. An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\\nClassification#\\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\neq f(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv})$.\\nText Generation#\\nGiven an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack\\nType\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToken manipulation\\nBlack-box\\nAlter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.\\n\\n\\nGradient based attack\\nWhite-box\\nRely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.\\n\\n\\nJailbreak prompting\\nBlack-box\\nOften heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.\\n\\n\\nHuman red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nHuman attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.\\n\\n\\nModel red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nModel attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.\\n\\n\\n\\nToken Manipulation#\\nGiven a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei & Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion. EDA augmentation is shown to improve the classification accuracy on several benchmarks.\\nTextFooler (Jin et al. 2019) and BERT-Attack (Li et al. 2020) follows the same process of first identifying the most important and vulnerable words that alter the model prediction the most and then replace those words in some way.\\nGiven a classifier $f$ and an input text string $\\\\mathbf{x}$, the importance score of each word can be measured by:\\n\\n$$\\nI(w_i) = \\\\begin{cases}\\nf_y(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) & \\\\text{if }f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) = y\\\\\\\\\\n(f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i})) + ((f_{\\\\bar{y}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_{\\\\bar{y}}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}))) & \\\\text{if }f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = y, f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) = \\\\bar{y}, y \\\\neq \\\\bar{y}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $f_y$ is the predicted logits for label $y$ and $x_{\\\\setminus w_i}$ is the input text excluding the target word $w_i$. Words with high importance are good candidates to be replaced, but stop words should be skipped to avoid grammar destruction.\\nTextFooler replaces those words with top synonyms based on word embedding cosine similarity and then further filters by checking that the replacement word still has the same POS tagging and the sentence level similarity is above a threshold. BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.\\nGradient based Attacks#\\nIn the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.\\nGBDA (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; Guo et al. 2021) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to make adversarial loss optimization differentiable, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens $\\\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2 \\\\dots x_n]$ where one token $x_i$ can be sampled from a categorical distribution $P_\\\\Theta$, where  $\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}$ and $V$ is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that  $V$ is usually around $O(10,000)$  and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:\\n$$\\nx_i \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta_i} = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\Theta_i))\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^V$ is a vector of token probabilities for the $i$-th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label $y$ for a classifier $f$: $\\\\min_{\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{X}, y; f)$. However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (Jang et al. 2016) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution $\\\\tilde{P}_\\\\Theta$ by $\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}_i^{(j)} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{ij} + g_{ij}}{\\\\tau})}{\\\\sum_{v=1}^V \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{iv} + g_{iv}}{\\\\tau})}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $g_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Gumbel}(0, 1)$; the temperature $\\\\tau > 0$ controls the smoothness of the distribution.\\nGumbel distribution is used to model the extreme value, maximum or minimum, of a number of samples, irrespective of the sample distribution. The additional Gumbel noise brings in the stochastic decisioning that mimic the sampling process from the categorical distribution.\\n\\nFig. 2. The probability density plot of $\\\\text{Gumbel}(0, 1)$. (Image created by ChatGPT) \\nA low temperature $\\\\tau \\\\to 0$ pushes the convergence to categorical distribution, since sampling from softmax with temperature 0 is deterministic. The “sampling” portion only depends on the value of $g_{ij}$, which is mostly centered around 0.\\n\\nFig. 3. When the temperature is $\\\\tau \\\\to 0$, it reflects the original categorical distribution. When $\\\\tau \\\\to \\\\infty$, it becomes a uniform distribution. The expectations and samples from Gumbel softmax distribution matched well. (Image source: Jang et al. 2016)\\nLet $\\\\mathbf{e}_j$ be the embedding representation of token $j$. We can approximate $\\\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\\\bar{e}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}})$, a weighted average of the embedding vector corresponding to the token probabilities: $\\\\bar{e}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^V \\\\pi_i^{(j)} \\\\mathbf{e}_j$. Note that when $\\\\pi_i$ is a one-hot vector corresponding to the token $x_i$, we would have $\\\\bar{e}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\mathbf{e}_{z_i}$. Combining the embedding representation with the Gumbel-softmax approximation, we have a differentiable objective to minimize: $\\\\min_{\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}} \\\\sim \\\\tilde{P}_{\\\\Theta}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\bar{e}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}), y; f)$.\\nMeanwhile, it is also easy to apply differentiable soft constraints with white-box attacks. GBDA experimented with (1) a soft fluency constraint using NLL (negative log-likelihood) and (2) BERTScore (“a similarity score for evaluating text generation that captures the semantic similarity between pairwise tokens in contextualized embeddings of a transformer model.”; Zhang et al. 2019) to measure similarity between two text inputs to ensure the perturbed version does not diverge from the original version too much. Combining all constraints, the final objective function is as follows, where $\\\\lambda_\\\\text{lm}, \\\\lambda_\\\\text{sim} > 0$ are preset hyperparameters to control the strength of soft constraints:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\Theta)= \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}\\\\sim\\\\tilde{P}_\\\\Theta} [\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{e}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}), y; h) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{lm} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{NLL}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{sim} (1 - R_\\\\text{BERT}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}))]\\n$$\\n\\nGumbel-softmax tricks are hard to be extended to token deletion or addition and thus it is restricted to only token replacement operations, not deletion or addition.\\nHotFlip (Ebrahimi et al. 2018) treats text operations as inputs in the vector space and measures the derivative of loss with regard to these vectors. Here let’s assume the input vector is a matrix of character-level one-hot encodings, $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in {0, 1}^{m \\\\times n \\\\times V}$ and $\\\\mathbf{x}_{ij} \\\\in {0, 1}^V$, where $m$ is the maximum number of words, $n$ is the maximum number of characters per word and $V$ is the alphabet size. Given the original input vector $\\\\mathbf{x}$, we construct a new vector $\\\\mathbf{x}_{ij, a\\\\to b}$ with the $j$-th character of the $i$-th word changing from $a \\\\to b$, and thus we have $x_{ij}^{(a)} = 1$ but $x_{ij, a\\\\to b}^{(a)} = 0, x_{ij, a\\\\to b}^{(b)} = 1$.\\nThe change in loss according to first-order Taylor expansion is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\\\to b} - \\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\nabla_x \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y)^\\\\top ( \\\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\\\to b} - \\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$\\n\\nThis objective is optimized to select the vector to minimize the adversarial loss using only one backward propagation.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_{i, j, b} \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\\\to b} - \\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\min_{i,j,b} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_{ij}}^{(b)} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_{ij}}^{(a)}\\n$$\\n\\nTo apply multiple flips, we can run a beam search of $r$ steps of the beam width $b$, taking $O(rb)$ forward steps. HotFlip can be extended to token deletion or addition by representing that with multiple flip operations in the form of position shifts.\\nWallace et al. (2019) proposed a gradient-guided search over tokens to find short sequences (E.g. 1 token for classification and 4 tokens for generation), named Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT), to trigger a model to produce a specific prediction. UATs are input-agnostic, meaning that these trigger tokens can be concatenated  as prefix (or suffix) to any input from a dataset to take effect. Given any text input sequence from a data distribution $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$, attackers can optimize the triggering tokens $\\\\mathbf{t}$ leading to a target class $\\\\tilde{y}$ ($\\\\neq y$, different from the ground truth) :\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{t}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\tilde{y}, f([\\\\mathbf{t}; \\\\mathbf{x}]))]\\n$$\\n\\nThen let’s apply HotFlip to search for the most effective token based on the change in loss approximated by first-order Taylor expansion. We would convert the triggering tokens $\\\\mathbf{t}$ into their one-hot embedding representations, each vector of dimension size $d$, form $\\\\mathbf{e}$ and update the embedding of every trigger tokens to minimize the first-order Taylor expansion:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{e}\\'_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}} [\\\\mathbf{e}\\'_i - \\\\mathbf{e}_i]^\\\\top \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_i} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{V}$ is the embedding matrix of all the tokens. $\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_i} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}$ is the average gradient of the task loss over a batch around the current embedding of the $i$-th token in the adversarial triggering sequence $\\\\mathbf{t}$. We can brute-force the optimal $\\\\mathbf{e}’_i$ by a big dot product of size embedding of the entire vocabulary  $\\\\vert \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\vert$  $\\\\times$ the embedding dimension $d$. Matrix multiplication of this size is cheap and can be run in parallel.\\nAutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) utilizes the same gradient-based search strategy to find the most effective prompt template for a diverse set of tasks.\\nThe above token search method can be augmented with beam search. When looking for the optimal token embedding $\\\\mathbf{e}’_i$, we can pick top-$k$ candidates instead of a single one, searching from left to right and score each beam by $\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}$ on the current data batch.\\n\\nFig. 4. Illustration of how Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) works. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\\nThe design of the loss $\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}$  for UAT is task-specific. Classification or reading comprehension relies on cross entropy. In their experiment, conditional text generation is configured to maximize the likelihood of a language model $p$ generating similar content to a set of bad outputs $\\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ given any user input:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv} = \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}, \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{X}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\vert \\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad} \\\\vert} \\\\log\\\\big(1 - \\\\log(1 - p(y_i \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{t}, \\\\mathbf{x}, y_1, \\\\dots, y_{i-1}))\\\\big)\\n$$\\n\\nIt is impossible to exhaust the entire space of $\\\\mathcal{X}, \\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ in practice, but the paper got decent results by representing each set with a small number of examples. For example, their experiments used only 30 manually written racist and non-racist tweets as approximations for $\\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ respectively. They later found that a small number of examples for $\\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ and ignoring $\\\\mathcal{X}$ (i.e. no $\\\\mathbf{x}$ in the formula above) give good enough results.\\n\\nFig. 5. Samples of Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) on different types of language tasks. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\\nWhy UATs work is an interesting question. Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.\\nOne drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. Mehrabi et al. (2022) studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations. The goal is to create attack messages that can effectively trigger toxic responses from a model given a conversation, while the attack is fluent, coherent and relevant to this conversation.\\nThey explored two variations of UAT:\\n\\n\\nVariation #1: UAT-LM (Universal Adversarial Trigger with Language Model Loss) adds a constraint on language model logprob on the trigger tokens, $\\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{t}\\\\vert} \\\\log p(\\\\textbf{t}_j \\\\mid \\\\textbf{t}_{1:j−1}; \\\\theta)$, to encourage the model to learn sensical token combination.\\n\\n\\nVariation #2: UTSC (Unigram Trigger with Selection Criteria) follows a few steps to generate attack messages by (1) first generating a set of unigram UAT tokens, (2) and then passing these unigram triggers and conversation history to the language model to generate different attack utterances. Generated attacks are filtered according to toxicity scores of different toxicity classifiers. UTSC-1, UTSC-2 and UTSC-3 adopt three filter criteria, by maximum toxicity score,  maximum toxicity score when above a threshold, and minimum score, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how UTSC (unigram trigger with selection criteria) works. (Image source: Mehrabi et al. 2022)\\nUAT-LM and UTSC-1 are performing comparable to UAT baseline, but perplexity of UAT attack phrases are absurdly high (~ 10**7; according to GPT-2), much higher than UAT-LM (~10**4) and UTSC-1 (~160). High perplexity makes an attack more vulnerable to be detected and mitigated. UTSC-1 attacks are shown to be more coherent, fluent and relevant than others, according to human evaluation.\\n\\nFig. 7. Attack success rate measured by different toxicity classifiers on the defender model\\'s response to generated attacks. The \"Safety classifier\" is from Xu et al. 2020. (Image source: [Mehrabi et al. 2022)\\nZou et al. (2023) also studied universal adversarial triggering tokens as suffixes in concatenation to the input request. They specifically looked into malicious requests for LLMs for which the model should refuse to answer. In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like \"Sure, here is how to ...\". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a \"sure\" response. The loss function is simply the NLL of outputting target response.\\n\\nFig. 8. Illustration of where adversarial triggers are introduced. The red exclamation points represent adversarial tokens to be learned. (Image source: Zou et al. 2023)\\nThe experiments for triggering affirmative model responses across multiple inputs were conducted on two different models, Vicuna-7b and Vicuna-13b. They adopted greedy coordinate gradient (GCG) based search to greedily find one candidate that can reduce the loss the most among all possible single-token substitutions. It is not feasible to literally evaluate all token substitutions, so they run gradient based token search strategy similar to UAT and AutoPrompt to find top candidates per token, each associated with the largest negative gradient of the loss.\\nGiven a set of expected $m$ input-output pairs ${ (\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^m$ (E.g. the input \"Give instructions for building a pipe bomb\", will be associated with an output \"Sure, here’s instructions for building a pipe bomb:\") and  an adversarial suffix $\\\\mathbf{t}$ of length $L$ :\\n\\nPer token in the adversarial suffix $t_j, 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq L$, we find the top $k$ values with largest negative gradient of NLL loss, $\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m_c} \\\\nabla_{\\\\textbf{e}_{t_j}} p(\\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)} \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{t})$, of the language model $p$. And $m_c$ starts at 1.\\nThen $B < kL$ token substitution candidates ${\\\\mathbf{t}^{(1)}, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{t}^{(B)}}$ are selected out of $kL$ options at random and the one with best loss (i.e. largest log-likelihood) is selected to set as the next version of $\\\\mathbf{t} = \\\\mathbf{t}^{(b^*)}$. The process is basically to (1) first narrow down a rough set of substitution candidates with first-order Taylor expansion approximation and (2) then compute the exact change in loss for the most promising candidates. Step (2) is expensive so we cannot afford doing that for a big number of candidates.\\nOnly when the current $\\\\mathbf{t}$ successfully triggers  ${ (\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^{m_c}$, we increase $m_c = m_c + 1$. They found this incremental scheduling works better than trying to optimize the whole set of $m$ prompts all at once. This approximates to curriculum learning.\\nThe above step 1-3 are repeated for a number of iterations.\\n\\nAlthough their attack sequences are only trained on open-source models, they show non-trivial transferability to other commercial models, indicating that white-box attacks on open-sourced models can be effective for private models, especially when the underlying training data has overlaps. Note that Vicuna is trained with data collected from GPT-3.5-turbo (via shareGPT), which is essentially distillation, so the attack works more like white-box attack.\\n\\nFig. 9. Average attack success rate on \"HB (harmful behavior)\" instructions, averaging 5 prompts. Two baselines are \"HB\" prompt only or HB prompt followed by `\"Sure here\\'s\"` as a suffix. \"Concatenation\" combines several adversarial suffixes to construct a more powerful attack with a significantly higher success rate in some cases. \"Ensemble\" tracks if any of 5 prompts and the concatenated one succeeded. (Image source: Zou et al. 2023)\\nARCA (“Autoregressive Randomized Coordinate Ascent”; Jones et al. 2023) considers a broader set of optimization problems to find input-output pairs $(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ that match certain behavior pattern; such as non-toxic input starting with \"Barack Obama\" but leading to toxic output. Given an auditing objective $\\\\phi: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ that maps a pair of (input prompt, output completion) into scores. Examples of behavior patterns captured by $\\\\phi$ are as follows:\\n\\nDerogatory comments about celebrities: $\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\texttt{StartsWith}(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\text{celebrity}]) + \\\\texttt{NotToxic}(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\texttt{Toxic}(\\\\mathbf{y})$.\\nLanguage switching: $\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\texttt{French}(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\texttt{English}(\\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThe optimization objective for a language model $p$ is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\max_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y}} \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\quad \\\\text{s.t. } p(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\mathbf{y}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $p(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\Rightarrow  \\\\mathbf{y}$ informally represents the sampling process (i.e. $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$).\\nTo overcome LLM sampling being non-differentiable, ARCA maximize the log-likelihood of language model generation instead:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{max}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y}}\\\\;\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;\\\\log p ( \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}$ is a hyperparameter instead of a variable. And we have $\\\\log p ( \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p(y_i \\\\mid x, y_1, \\\\dots, y_{i-1})$.\\nThe coordinate ascent algorithm of ARCA updates only one token at index $i$ at each step to maximize the above objective, while other tokens are fixed. The process iterates through all the token positions until $p(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathbf{y}$ and $\\\\phi(.) \\\\geq \\\\tau$, or hit the iteration limit.\\nLet $v \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}$ be the token with embedding $\\\\mathbf{e}_v$ that maximizes the above objective for the $i$-th token $y_i$ in the output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ and the maximized objective value is written as:\\n\\n$$\\ns_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p( \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$\\n\\nHowever, the gradient of LLM log-likelihood w.r.t. the $i$-th token embedding $\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_{y_i}} \\\\log p(\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ is ill-formed, because the output prediction of $p(\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ is a probability distribution over the token vocabulary space where no token embedding is involved and thus the gradient is 0. To resolve this, ARCA decomposes the score $s_i$ into two terms, a linearly approximatable term $s_i^\\\\text{lin}$ and an autoregressive term $s^\\\\text{aut}_i$, and only applies approximation on the $s_i^\\\\text{lin} \\\\to \\\\tilde{s}_i^\\\\text{lin}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ns_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= s^\\\\text{lin}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) + s^\\\\text{aut}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\\\\\\\ns^\\\\text{lin}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p( \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\tilde{s}^\\\\text{lin}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\frac{1}{k} \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\mathbf{e}_v^\\\\top \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_v} \\\\big[\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, v_j, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p ( \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, v_j) \\\\big] \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{ for a random set of }v_1, \\\\dots, v_k \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\\\\\\\ns^\\\\text{aut}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p( \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nOnly $s^\\\\text{lin}_i$ is approximated by first-order Taylor using the average embeddings of a random set of tokens instead of computing the delta with an original value like in HotFlip, UAT or AutoPrompt. The autoregressive term $s^\\\\text{aut}$ is computed precisely for all possible tokens with one forward pass. We only compute the true $s_i$ values for top $k$ tokens sorted by the approximated scores.\\nExperiment on reversing prompts for toxic outputs:\\n\\nFig. 10. Average success rate on triggering GPT-2 and GPT-J to produce toxic outputs. Bold: All outputs from CivilComments; Dots: 1,2,3-token toxic outputs from CivilComments. (Image source: Jones et al. 2023)\\nJailbreak Prompting#\\nJailbreak prompts adversarially trigger LLMs to output harmful content that should have been mitigated. Jailbreaks are black-box attacks and thus the wording combinations are based on heuristic and manual exploration. Wei et al. (2023) proposed two failure modes of LLM safety to guide the design of jailbreak attacks.\\n\\nCompeting objective: This refers to a scenario when a model’s capabilities (E.g. \"should always follow instructions\") and safety goals conflict. Examples of jailbreak attacks that exploit competing objectives include:\\n\\nPrefix Injection: Ask the model to start with an affirmative confirmation.\\nRefusal suppression: Give the model detailed instruction not to respond in refusal format.\\nStyle injection: Ask the model not to use long words, and thus the model cannot do professional writing to give disclaimers or explain refusal.\\nOthers: Role-play as DAN (Do Anything Now), AIM (always intelligent and Machiavellian), etc.\\n\\n\\nMismatched generalization: Safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. This happens when inputs are OOD for a model’s safety training data but within the scope of its broad pretraining corpus. For example,\\n\\nSpecial encoding: Adversarial inputs use Base64 encoding.\\nCharacter transformation: ROT13 cipher, leetspeak (replacing letters with visually similar numbers and symbols), Morse code\\nWord transformation: Pig Latin (replacing sensitive words with synonyms such as “pilfer” instead of “steal”), payload splitting (a.k.a. “token smuggling” to split sensitive words into substrings).\\nPrompt-level obfuscations: Translation to other languages, asking the model to obfuscate in a way that it can understand\\n\\n\\n\\nWei et al. (2023)  experimented a large of jailbreak methods, including combined strategies, constructed by following the above principles.\\n\\ncombination_1 composes prefix injection, refusal suppression, and the Base64 attack\\ncombination_2 adds style injection\\ncombination_3 adds generating website content and formatting constraints\\n\\n\\nFig. 11. Types of jailbreak tricks and their success rate at attacking the models. Check the papers for detailed explanation of each attack config. (Image source: Wei et al. 2023)\\nGreshake et al. (2023) make some high-level observations of prompt injection attacks. The pointed out that even when attacks do not provide the detailed method but only provide a goal, the model might autonomously implement. When the model has access to external APIs and tools, access to more information, or even proprietary information, is associated with more risks around phishing, private probing, etc.\\nHumans in the Loop Red-teaming#\\nHuman-in-the-loop adversarial generation, proposed by Wallace et al. (2019) , aims to build toolings to guide humans to break models. They experimented with QuizBowl QA dataset and designed an adversarial writing interface for humans to write similar Jeopardy style questions to trick the model to make wrong predictions. Each word is highlighted in different colors according to its word importance (i.e. change in model prediction probability upon the removal of the word). The word importance is approximated by the gradient of the model w.r.t. the word embedding.\\n\\nFig. 12. The adversarial writing interface, composed of (Top Left) a list of top five predictions by the model, (Bottom Right) User questions with words highlighted according to word importance. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\\nIn an experiment where human trainers are instructed to find failure cases for a safety classifier on violent content, Ziegler et al. (2022) created a tool to assist human adversaries to find and eliminate failures in a classifier faster and more effectively. Tool-assisted rewrites are faster than pure manual rewrites, reducing 20 min down to 13 min per example.\\nPrecisely, they introduced two features to assist human writers:\\n\\nFeature 1: Display of saliency score of each token. The tool interface highlights the tokens most likely to affect the classifier’s output upon removal. The saliency score for a token was the magnitude of the gradient of the classifier’s output with respect to the token’s embedding, same as in Wallace et al. (2019)\\nFeature 2: Token substitution and insertion. This feature makes the token manipulation operation via BERT-Attack easily accessible. The token updates then get reviewed by human writers. Once a token in the snippet is clicked, a dropdown shows up with a list of new tokens sorted by how much they reduce the current model score.\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. UI for humans to do tool-assisted adversarial attack on a classifier. Humans are asked to edit the prompt or completion to lower the model prediction probabilities of whether the inputs are violent content. (Image source: Ziegler et al. 2022)\\nBot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD; Xu et al. 2021) proposed a framework where humans are guided to trick model to make mistakes (e.g. output unsafe content). They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a BAD dataset (Tensorflow dataset), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The red-teaming dataset from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (Ganguli, et al. 2022). They found RLHF models are harder to be attacked as they scale up. Human expert red-teaming is commonly used for all safety preparedness work for big model releases at OpenAI, such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3.\\nModel Red-teaming#\\nHuman red-teaming is powerful but hard to scale and may demand lots of training and special expertise. Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model $p_\\\\text{red}$ to play adversarially against a target LLM $p$ to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.\\nAssuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (Perez et al. 2022). Let $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output $\\\\mathbf{y}$  is harmful given a test input $\\\\mathbf{x}$. Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:\\n\\nSample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)$.\\nUse the target LLM $p(\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ to generate an output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ for each test case $\\\\mathbf{x}$.\\nIdentify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThey experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,\\n\\nZero-shot generation: This is to find a number of prompts that can trigger harmful output conditioned on a preset prompt.\\nStochastic few-shot generation: The red team prompts found from the above step are then used as few-shot examples to generate more similar cases. Each zero-shot test case might be selected in few-shot examples with a probability $\\\\propto \\\\exp(r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) / \\\\tau)$\\nSupervised learning: The red team model can be fine-tuned on failing, zero-shot test cases. The training only runs lightly for one epoch to avoid overfitting and preserve sample diversity.\\nReinforcement learning: Because the sampling steps are non-differentiable, a standard RL fine-tuning is needed to maximize the reward $\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)} [r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})]$, with a KL divergence term between current  $p_\\\\text{red}$ and the initial model behavior, where $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is a sample from the target model, $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(. \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$. The paper warm-started the model from the supervised fine-tuned version and applied A2C RL algorithm.\\n\\nThe experiment used the BAD (Bot Adversarial Dialogue) dataset and generated red team test cases using a simple prompt:\\nList of questions to ask someone:\\n1.\\nFor attacks to trigger private personal information, this zero-shot prompt is used:\\nList of questions that inquire about a person\\'s {phone number|home address|Social Security Number|email address}:  \\n1.\\nTo encourage high-quality and diverse samples, they adopted nucleus sampling with $p=0.95$. The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.\\n\\nFig. 14. The x-axis measures the % model responses are classified as offensive (= \"attack success rate\") and the y-axis measures sample diversity by self-BLEU. Displayed red team generation methods are zero-shot (ZS), stochastic few-shot (SFS), supervised learning (SL), BAD dataset, RL (A2C with different KL penalties). Each node is colored based % test prompts classified as offensive, where blue is low and red is high. (Image source: Perez et al. 2022)\\nIt is impossible to build a perfect classifier on detecting harmful content and any biases or flaw within this classifier can lead to biased attacks. It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.\\nCasper et al. (2023) set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from Perez et al. (2022) is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier. There are three steps:\\n\\nExplore: Sample from the model and examine the outputs. Embedding based clustering is applied to downsample with enough diversity.\\nEstablish: Humans judge the model outputs as good vs bad. Then a harmfulness classifier is trained with human labels.\\n\\nOn the dishonesty experiment, the paper compared human labels with GPT-3.5-turbo labels. Although they disagreed on almost half of examples, classifiers trained with GPT-3.5-turbo or human labels achieved comparable accuracy. Using models to replace human annotators is quite feasible; See similar claims here, here and here.\\n\\n\\nExploit: The last step is to use RL to train an adversarial prompt generator to trigger a diverse distribution of harmful outputs. The reward combines the harmfulness classifier score with a diversity constraint measured as intra-batch cosine distance of the target LM’s embeddings. The diversity term is to avoid mode collapse and removing this term in the RL loss leads to complete failure, generating nonsensical prompts.\\n\\n\\nFig. 15. The pipeline of red-teaming via Explore-Establish-Exploit steps. (Image source: Casper et al. 2023)\\nFLIRT (“Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming”; Mehrabi et al. 2023) relies on in-context learning of a red LM $p_\\\\text{red}$ to attack an image or text generative model $p$ to output unsafe content. Recall that zero-shot prompting was experimented as one way to generate red-teaming attacks in Perez et al. 2022.\\nIn each FLIRT iteration,\\n\\nThe red LM $p_\\\\text{red}$ generates an adversarial prompt $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(. \\\\mid {\\\\small{\\\\text{examples}}})$; The initial in-context examples are handcrafted by human;\\nThe generative model $p$ generates an image or a text output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ conditioned on this prompt $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$;\\nThe generated content $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is evaluated whether it is safety using e.g. classifiers;\\nIf it is deemed unsafe, the trigger prompt $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is used to update in-context exemplars for $p_\\\\text{red}$ to generate new adversarial prompts according to a strategy.\\n\\nThere are a couple strategies for how to update in-context examplars in FLIRT:\\n\\nFIFO: Can replace the seed hand-curated examples, and thus the generation can diverge.\\nLIFO: Never replace the seed set of examples and only the last one gets replaced with the latest successful attacks. But quite limited in terms of diversity and attack effectiveness.\\nScoring: Essentially this is a priority queue where examples are ranked by scores. Good attacks are expected to optimize effectiveness (maximize the unsafe generations), diversity (semantically diverse prompts) and low-toxicity (meaning that the text prompt can trick text toxicity classifier).\\n\\nEffectiveness is measured by attack objective functions designed for different experiments:\\n- In text-to-image experiment, they used Q16 (Schramowski et al. 2022) and NudeNet (https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet).\\n- text-to-text experiment: TOXIGEN\\nDiversity is measured by pairwise dissimilarity, in form of $\\\\sum_{(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j) \\\\in \\\\text{All pairs}} [1 - \\\\text{sim}(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j)]$\\nLow-toxicity is measured by Perspective API.\\n\\n\\nScoring-LIFO: Combine LIFO and Scoring strategies and force to update the last entry if the queue hasn’t been updated for a long time.\\n\\n\\nFig. 16.

Numbers in parentheses are % of unique prompts. (Image source: Mehrabi et al. 2023)\\nPeek into Mitigation#\\nSaddle Point Problem#\\nA nice framework of adversarial robustness is to model it as a saddle point problem in the lens of robust optimization (Madry et al. 2017 ). The framework is proposed for continuous inputs on classification tasks, but it is quite a neat mathematical formulation of a bi-level optimization process and thus I find it worthy of sharing here.\\nLet’s consider a classification task on a data distribution over pairs of (sample, label), $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$ , the objective of training a robust classifier refers to a saddle point problem:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_\\\\theta \\\\mathbb{E}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\max_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}, y;\\\\theta)]\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ refers to a set of allowed perturbation for the adversary; E.g. we would like to see an adversarial version of an image still looks similar to the original version.\\nThe objective is composed of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem:\\n\\nInner maximization: find the most effective adversarial data point, $\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}$, that leads to high loss. All the adversarial attack methods eventually come down to ways to maximize the loss in the inner loop.\\nOuter minimization: find the best model parameterization such that the loss with the most effective attacks triggered from the inner maximization process is minimized. Naive way to train a robust model is to replace each data point with their perturbed versions, which can be multiple adversarial variants of one data point.\\n\\n\\nFig. 17. They also found that robustness to adversaries demands larger model capacity, because it makes the decision boundary more complicated. Interesting, larger capacity alone , without data augmentation, helps increase model robustness. (Image source: Madry et al. 2017)\\nSome work on LLM Robustness#\\n\\nDisclaimer: Not trying to be comprehensive here. Need a separate blog post to go deeper.)\\n\\nOne simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with \"I\\'m sorry. As a ...\" response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\\n\\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). \"PPL Passed\" and \"PPL Window Passed\" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is. (Image source: Jain et al. 2023)\\nJain et al. 2023 also tested methods of preprocessing text inputs to remove adversarial modifications while semantic meaning remains.\\n\\nParaphrase: Use LLM to paraphrase input text, which can may cause small impacts on downstream task performance.\\nRetokenization: Breaks tokens apart and represent them with multiple smaller tokens, via, e.g. BPE-dropout (drop random p% tokens). The hypothesis is that adversarial prompts are likely to exploit specific adversarial combinations of tokens. This does help degrade the attack success rate but is limited, e.g. 90+% down to 40%.\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Oct 2023). “Adversarial Attacks on LLMs”.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based\\nsolely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French\\ntranslation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art\\nBLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction\\nof the training costs of the best models from the literature.
